# M3AE: Multimodal Representation Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities

## The code is preparing in few days.

## Dataset: [Brats 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanglequang/brats2018) and [Brats 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data?resource=download) or from [RFnet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AwLwGgEBQwesIDTlWpubbwqxxd8brt5A?usp=sharing) for dataset and split files.

## Training process:

1. change the path in ./dataset/brats.py to your dataset path.
2. run pretrain.py via pre.sh.
3. change the pretrained chackpoint path in train_18.py and run it via run.py
